Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) Coursework
This repository contains coursework from the Complex Adaptive Systems class, focusing on foundational concepts in linear algebra and various neural network architectures. The assignments are implemented primarily in MATLAB, but 1-7 are in Python.‚Äã

Structure:
Assignments 1‚Äì7: PDF documents of Python script detailing theoretical concepts and problem sets.
Assignments 8‚Äì10: MATLAB .m files implementing neural network models and simulations.‚Äã

Neural Network Models Covered:

Feedforward Neural Network (FNN): A multi-layer network where connections do not form cycles.

Self-Organizing Map (SOM): An unsupervised learning model for dimensionality reduction.

Hopfield Neural Network (HNN): A recurrent network used for associative memory.

Spiking Neural Network (SNN): A model that incorporates time into neuron activation.

Scale-Free Network: A network whose degree distribution follows a power law.‚Äã
